# 🚀 Predicting Hospital Readmissions

Welcome to our **Predicting Hospital Readmissions** project! 
This repository contains our work on developing AI-based predictive models to determine the likelihood of patient readmission after discharge. 
Our approach involves machine learning techniques, fine-tuned Large Language Models, and API calls to established LLMs to build an effective predictive system.
